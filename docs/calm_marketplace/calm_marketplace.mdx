## Publishing Blueprints from Marketplace Manager

By default, Calm comes pre-seeded with validated Blueprints for multiple open source and enterprise applications. Marketplace Manager acts as a
staging area for publishing default and user-created Blueprints to your local Marketplace. The Marketplace acts as an application store,
providing end users with a catalog of available applications.

## Takeaways

-   By using pre-seeded Blueprints from the Nutanix Marketplace, userscan quickly try out new applications.
-   Marketplace Blueprints can be cloned and modified to suit a user's needs. For example, the pre-seeded LAMP Blueprint could be a
    starting point for a developer looking to swap PHP for a Go application server.
-   Marketplace Blueprints can use local disk images or automatically download associated disk images. Users can create their own keys and
    slipstream them into Blueprints (via cloud-init) to control access.
-   Developers can publish Blueprints to the Marketplace for fast and easy consumption by users.
-   Blueprints can be launched directly from the Marketplace with no additional configuration from users, delivering a public cloud-like
    SaaS experience for end users.
-   Administrators have control over what Blueprints are published to the Marketplace and which projects have access to published Blueprints.
